      <description>Chapter 3 Shortcodes Hugo uses Markdown for its simple content format. However, there are a lot of things that Markdown doesnâ€™t support well. You could use pure HTML to expand possibilities.
But this happens to be a bad idea. Everyone uses Markdown because it&amp;rsquo;s pure and simple to read even non-rendered. You should avoid HTML to keep it as simple as possible.
To avoid this limitations, Hugo created shortcodes. A shortcode is a simple snippet inside a page.</description>
